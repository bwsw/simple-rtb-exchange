/** Native type impression.
  *
  * Native ad units are intended to blend seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a
  * sponsored Twitter or Facebook post). As such, the response must be well-structured to afford
  * the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.
  *
  * The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the Native
  * Ad Specification. It defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native
  * ad units. This object provides the means of transporting request parameters as an opaque
  * string so that the specific parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Native
  * Ad Specification. Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that
  * specification.
  *
  * The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression
  * is offered as a native type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression
  * may also be offered as banner and/or video by also including as Imp subordinates the Banner
  * and/or Video objects, respectively. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to
  * one of the offered types.
